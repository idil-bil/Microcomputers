##Labs

### Lab 3
Design a state machine and connect it to the seven segment LEDs on the DE1-SoC via a combinational logic block.

### Lab 4
Get practice writing ARM assembly code using the ARM Cortex-A9 built into the Cyclone V FPGA on your DE1-SoC.

### Lab 5
Build a computer that implements a “Reduced Instruction Set Computer” (RISC).

### Lab 6
Adding a finite state machine controller to automate the process of setting control inputs to the datapath and instruction register to control the finite state machine from Lab 5.

### Lab 7
Add a read-write memory to hold instructions to Lab 6, so you no longer need to enter each instruction using the slider switches.
